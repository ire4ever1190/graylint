 graylint
==========

This tool can run various Python linters and filter linter messages to only those
which were caused by recent changes to the code base being linted.

Originally this functionality lived in the Darker_ package, but since version 2.0.0
Darker only focuses on reformatting code while the linting capability continues in
Graylint.
